# CGP [0022]: Contracts Release 3

- Date: 2021-03-01
- Author(s): @yorhodes @yaz
- Status: DRAFT
- Governance Proposal ID #: TBD
- Date Executed: TBD
- Discussions To: https://forum.celo.org/t/core-contracts-release-3/755 

## Overview

In this governance proposal, we propose to execute the Celo Core Contracts Upgrade Release 3. This release follows the release process as established by the release in CGP13. After release 1 and 2, release 3 is focused on helping activation of cEUR on Celo.

The changes proposed are described in the [release notes](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/celo-core-contracts-v3.rc0). 

## Proposed Changes

Please see the release notes to more details on the changes itself. The actual on-chain effects are as follows:

Core Contracts (as `setImplementation`)
* TBD
* TBD

## Verification

This release marks the first time we have environment-specific initialization parameters, which requires a unique verification input on each environment. This CGP will be updated with the requisite initalization parameters when the release is proposed on the baklava, alfajores, and mainnet environments.

## Risks

Celo Core Contracts are critical for the functioning of the Celo Platform. This proposal touches contracts which impact Celo's exchange. While cLabs have invested significant efforts to expand testing and verification tooling, and a third party audit has been completed, errors in this proposal could lead to situations that are only recoverable with a very difficult hard fork.
