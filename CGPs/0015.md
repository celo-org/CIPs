- Date: 07 July 2020, updated 30 Oct 2020
- Author(s): @alchemydc
- Status: DRAFT
- Governance Proposal ID #: GCP [0015]
- Date Executed: TBD

## Overview

This proposal requests that the Celo community add Zcash (ZEC) to the basket of currencies used to stabilize the value of Celo stable assets (initially cUSD).

Zcash meets the requirements specified by the Celo community, as described in [this post](https://medium.com/celoorg/the-celo-reserve-faqs-f3f7cbb1991f), specifically:

>What are the criteria for selecting reserve assets? Reserve asset selection is done through governance by the community. At the moment, any new reserve assets under consideration should be freely traded and settled 24/7 on liquid markets, and should be based on an open-source protocol.

## Why Zcash

### Background
Zcash was created in 2016, as a code fork of Bitcoin.  Unlike Bitcoin, Zcash uses zk-SNARKs to provide [robust on-chain privacy](https://z.cash/technology/).  Zcash is traded 24x7 on some of the most well known and highly regulated [exchanges](https://z.cash/exchanges/), and enjoys [relatively deep liquidity](https://messari.io/screener/use-E8EB413C).  Zcash is widely supported by [reputable custodians](https://z.cash/investors/).  [Viewing keys](https://electriccoin.co/blog/explaining-viewing-keys/) could be used to provide for transparency and audibility of the reserve funds, while maintaining strong on-chain privacy. The Zcash [protocol specification](https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/master/protocol/protocol.pdf) is open source, as are the independently maintained [zcashd (c++)](https://github.com/zcash/zcash) and [zebrad (rust)](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra) implementations of the protocol.

Zcash has long been known as a "privacy coin", based on its robust layer 1 transaction privacy capabilities.  However, recently, regulators have begun to understand that there is a difference between "anonymity" and "confidentiality", and that the latter is required in order for blockchain based digital payments systems to supplant legacy systems.  Notably, Gemini, arguably the most highly regulated exchange in the world, recently added support for customers to [withdraw shielded Zcash](https://www.coindesk.com/regulated-us-exchange-gemini-now-offers-confidential-zcash-withdrawals).  equating the experience to withdrawing cash from an ATM.  In this analogy, shared by the Gemini founders, your bank knows you pulled out cash, but doesn't need to know where you spent it.

Zcash would add diversity to the Celo reserve, which is important because Ethereum and DAI are closely interrelated, and the Celo native asset itself has upstream technological dependencies (eg Geth) on Ethereum. Ethereum (and Celo) both leverage the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which is what powers the "world computer". However, this programmability expands the vulnerability surface of these projects considerably.  Zcash is a good choice for the next reserve asset for Celo, in part because it is presently no more programmable than Bitcoin, and thus arguably has a smaller vulnerability surface than Ethereum and other Ethereum based projects.

### Mission Alignment
Zcash development is supported by the [Electric Coin Company](https://electriccoin.co/about/) as well as by the non-profit [Zcash Foundation](https://www.zfnd.org/).  The mission of the Electric Coin Company (ECC) is very closely aligned with the mission of the Celo project.  The owners of the ECC recently elected to [donate their shares](https://electriccoin.co/blog/eccs-owners-to-donate-ecc/) to the Bootstrap Project (Bootstrap), a new non-profit 501(c)3 dedicated to the uplift of humanity through technology, scientific discovery, education and human organization.  ECC will retain its current structure, including management, employees, and operations. While nothing will change within ECC, it will become wholly owned by Bootstrap rather than its current owners.

Both the ECC and Celo Foundation are dedicated to increasing economic freedom and opportunity for the citizens of the world.  The ECC has recently created a program called [Crypto in Context](https://underestimated.electriccoin.co/) which works actively to use cryptocurrency to onboard "the unbanked" into the new world of crypto-enabled finance.  [Elena Giralt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JOiBRSchO0) from the ECC team also facilitated a [workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G_iFRrQdZwWCv1GqWq8LPsZTmE0qoblL04g7q0eGrrY/edit?usp=sharing) on the relationship between privacy and economic freedom at the inaugural Celo retreat in 2019.

### Development Funding
Funding for ongoing development of Zcash was [recently renewed](https://electriccoin.co/reaching-consensus/) by the Zcash community, representing 20% of issuance (aka block rewards) for the four years from Nov 2020 through Nov 2024.  The funding will be split between the ECC (7%), the Zcash Foundation (5%), and a newly created Major Grants fund (8%).  Zcash Major Grants funding could be used to fund interoperability between the Zcash and Celo networks, for example to automate rebalancing of the target reserve allocation, or to provide strong on-chain privacy for Celo users.

### Towards a more decentralized reserve
The Celo community has expressed desire for the reserve to become more decentralized.  One key driver for this is the development of automated cross chain bridges that would allow reserve management to be automated.  Presently, the [Ren project](https://renproject.io/) provides a trustless bridge between Zcash and Ethereum.  Ren's ERC-20 representation of Zcash, known as renZEC, was recently ["greenlit"](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmzfpbnvhqezxv6b2enrltdehq3ybthavj73gyvk5fvubz) by the MakerDAO community, an important step in making Zcash (via renZEC) usable as collateral for minting DAI.  Porting the Ren bridge to Celo would be a relatively light engineering lift.  A [privacy preserving trustless bridge](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash-pegzone) is also under construction between Zcash and Cosmos.  Other Zcash<->Ethereum bridges have been proposed by the organizations behind [tBTC](https://tbtc.network/) and [wBTC](https://wbtc.network/).  

Funding for ongoing Zcash development is presently available from the [Zcash Foundation grants program](https://grants.zfnd.org/) and the forthcoming [Zcash Major Grants program](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/major-grants-review-committee-selection-process/).  It's likely that a proposal to build a trustless bridge between Zcash and Celo could be co-funded by sources from both the Zcash and Celo communities.

### Cryptographic DNA
The Zcash project was founded upon strong science, and the academic work of the Zcash [scientific founders](https://electriccoin.co/team/#scientists) has been foundational to various aspects of cryptocurrency.  Notably, [Eran Tromer](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/), who was one of the Zcash founding scientists, is also an advisor to the Celo project. Tromer has recently contributed to the development of the new [Plumo light client protocol](https://docs.zkproof.org/pages/standards/accepted-workshop3/proposal-plumo_celolightclient.pdf), which leverage zk-SNARKs to enable mobile devices to use Celo without downloading the entire blockchain.

### About the author
My name is [David Campbell](https://keybase.io/alchemydc), and I am responsible for operations at the ECC.  I also operate (personally) a [validator group](https://www.zanshindojo.org/) on the Celo network, and participated in the Great Celo Stake Off.  I also contributed a [significant refactor](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/pull/3888) of the Terraform code published by cLabs to support running mainnet validators in GCP.  More information about my interest in cryptography and privacy and a disclosure statement is available [here](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/dc-for-mgrc/36666).

## Proposed Changes
The present target allocation of the Celo reserve is as follows:
* 50% CELO
* 30% BTC
* 15% ETH
* 5% DAI

This proposal advocates that the target allocation of the Celo reserve be modified as follows:
* 50% CELO
* 30% BTC
* 10% ETH
* 5% DAI
* 5% ZEC


## Verification
This proposal involves no code changes or verification.  

## Risks
Zcash is a cryptocurrency, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum and DAI, the other assets in the Celo reserve.  Zcash has a considerably smaller market cap than Bitcoin or Ethereum, but this is in-part due to the project being younger and earlier along in its issuance schedule.

Zcash leverages novel cryptography.  The zk-SNARKs used to provide strong on-chain privacy are also complex and are sometimes referred to as "moon math".  The ECC has invested heavily in [security auditing](https://electriccoin.co/blog/auditing-zcash/) and has [worked diligently](https://electriccoin.co/blog/zcash-counterfeiting-vulnerability-successfully-remediated/) to successfully remediate a critical bug in the past.  The Zcash mainnet has been live since November of 2016, and has proven robust and resilient to attack since launch.

The target allocation proposed above takes into account these risks, and helps the Celo project further diversify the reserve while partnering with a project that represents strong ideological and technical alignment.
