## Overview

This CGP is an effort to set the downtime grace period specified in CIP-33 to `6250000000000000000000` 

The specification to add a downtime grace period and set the value to `6250000000000000000000` is specified in [CIP-33](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0033.md)

Contracts Release 3 in CGP-22 will include the governable downtime grace period and this current CGP will set its value to follow CIP-33.
