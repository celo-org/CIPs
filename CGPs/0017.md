## Overview

### 1. Goal
**Mission**: The Celo Community Fund’s mission is to support those who are building a financial system that creates conditions of prosperity for everyone. 

We propose to fund a diverse set of projects to help in achieving Celo’s mission. There might be some overlap with Celo Foundation’s funding process but the Celo Community Fund (CCF) will help:

*   Foster of a healthy ecosystem
*   Support decentralization
*   Provide a quicker turnaround on applications as there will be less friction without the need to coordinate with Celo Foundation

### 2. Progressive Decentralization
One of the feedbacks we got from the community was the complexity in the structure of the constitution and plan. We have simplified the proposal by avoiding highly structured constitutional documents and processes.

We will instead focus on creating a simple proposal that can be voted on by the community so that we can get it passed. The primary goal is to help enable quality projects that need funding. 

In the early days, as we build the ecosystem, we will start with a simpler process by electing the stewards and give them the ability to make decisions on a pre-approved amount of CELO. This will help alleviate the current tension of not having enough voter turnouts for Celo Governance Proposals. The current Celo Governance Process has high threshold requirements and a lot of coordination is required to get proposals to pass. In addition, it doesn't meet the needs of the CCF where additional time is required by the stewards to vet projects before bringing them to vote. 

By having this simpler process, we can avoid having to rally the entire community to vote on all Community Fund proposals, some of which might be requesting a small amount, for e.g., A university student requesting 1,000 cUSD to host a Celo educational Meetup.

While we do give the power to the stewards, trust has to be earned over time. So this proposal will set forth some controls in place to avoid misbehavior/bias by the stewards. For instance, having a recourse process for CCF applicants if they disagree with the decision of the stewards.

### 3. Implementation
We want to create an easy process in order to activate the CCF without having to build a complicated governance process that may or may not work. Instead, the plan is to start working with a simple process, learn as we grow, and then use the lessons to create a robust decentralized process later on. 

The following is the process we are recommending:

*   **2-of-3 smart contract**: that is controlled by the elected stewards. 
*   **Governance smart contract owned**: The 2-of-3 CCF smart contract would be owned by the Governance smart contract so that CELO owners can claw back CELO delegated to the stewards via CGP, if required
*   **Implementation**: We plan to hire cLabs to implement a contract on our behalf and repurpose one of the multi-sig smart contracts that OpenZeppelin has previously audited.
*   **Entity**: We will request help from the legal and regulatory team at Celo Foundation to help set up an appropriate entity.

### 4. Stewards and Applicants
The role of the stewards will be to:

*   Conduct community outreach to get projects built on Celo.
*   Manage the assessment of the applicants and their projects based on their mission, technical ability & merit, and integrity.
*   Capture the lessons learned and build a constitution to help the current and future operations of the Celo Community fund. We will use the document - [CCF v1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15xkmj6mXaLAjNcdvGX3PKGM3aanuvVL1IYXeWHvfxBs/edit#) - to guide us.

The applicants will complete an application form similar to that used by Celo Foundation and the stewards will vet the projects to the best of their abilities either by themselves or, if needed, getting feedback from appropriate experts.

The stewards will publish information about approved applications such as - team, proposed use of funds, and amount funded. Declined applications can expect to receive private feedback.   

If a proposer feels that they were unfairly denied funding from the steward’s budget, then the  conflict resolution process would be for them to submit a spend proposal via CGP for all CELO owners to vote on.


### 5. CGP Vote

#### 5.1 Smart Contract

*   2-of-3 multi-signature smart contract that is controlled by the elected stewards. Our proposal is to have three stewards within our group. 
*   The 2-of-3 CCF smart contract will be owned by the Governance smart contract so that CELO owners can claw back CELO via CGP, if required.

#### 5.2 Term
*   The following members would like to nominate themselves for the role of the stewards:
    *   Deepak Nuli, Founder at MultiSig, a boutique security consulting company in the blockchain space.
    *   Patrick Baron, Founder at Validator Capital and Moola, a Celo validator group and money market protocol.
    *   Dee, Usopp.Club, a genesis Celo validator group and a grateful producer of the first block of the chain.
*   The term we propose is until funds are spent with a goal of dispersing our budget to qualified projects within 6 months after the elections and appropriate steward entity is created.

#### 5.3 Voting on the Proposal and the Stewards
We are asking the community to vote both - on the proposal and for the stewards - at the same time under one proposal. This is due the to following reasons:

1. **Prevent voter fatigue**: by making them vote on two things. It’ll be easy to rally the Celo community behind one CGP.
2. **Keep the Celo Community Fund flexible**: A community member brought up this idea during a meeting - of being open to funding different steward teams. That is, we (Deepak, Patrick, and Dee) are applying as stewards and are requesting a certain amount to disperse. Another steward team could also make a similar proposal to use a part of the fund if needed.

#### 5.4 Budget Request
*   Amount: 665,387 CELO (Approximately 20% of the fund)
*   Management Fee: 10% + Incorporation fee (if needed)

Note: 

*   We increased the amount to account of 3 stewards while we had only 2 stewards in the prior version of the proposal.
*   This works out to compensation of ~$127 /hr/steward assuming:
    *   6 months of work is required 
    *   USD price of CELO = 1.77
    *   Stewards work 50 hours/month 
    *   3 stewards 
    *   Less than $450/month in operational expenses 

## Proposed Changes
1. Description of transaction (TBD)
  - Destination: TBD
  - Data: TBD
  - Value: 665,387 CELO

## Verification
TODO

## Risks
* **Loss of funds**: While we do give the power to the stewards, trust has to be earned over time. While we have done some work in the community prior to this proposal to build the trust, there is still a small risk. However, it is mitigated as all the three stewards are part of the Celo ecosystem without any prior relationship between them. They have a professional relationship through the Celo community.
* **Bias by the stewards**: If a proposer feels that they were unfairly denied funding from the steward’s budget, then the  conflict resolution process would be for them to submit a spend proposal via CGP for all CELO owners to vote on.
