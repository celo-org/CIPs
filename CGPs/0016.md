# CGP [0016]: Update baselineQuorumFactor and Referendum Stage Duration

- Date: 2020-12-01
- Author(s): @alecps
- Status: DRAFT
  - DRAFT = Feedback collection
  - PROPOSED = The governance proposal was submitted to the network
  - EXECUTED = The governance proposal was executed on the network
  - EXPIRED = The governance proposal expired
- Governance Proposal ID #: [if submitted]
- Date Executed: [if executed]

## Overview

This CGP is an effort to lower the barriers to passing governance proposals given current levels of voter engagement. It proposes changing two network parameters, the `baselineQuorumFactor` -- the proportion of the historical average voter participation level that constitutes quorum for governance proposals -- and the `referendumStageDuration` -- the length of time during which Celo holders may vote on a proposal after it has been approved. We propose a decrease in `baselineQuorumFactor` from `1` to `0.5` and an increase in the `referendumStageDuration` from `432000` (5 days) to `604800` (7 days).

The rational for lowering the `baselineQuorumFactor` is that it will immediately lower the baseline quorum which is currently too high to reliably pass governance proposals. The decision to lower the value to `0.5` is informed by the current voter participation level that we can assume will reliably vote for governance proposals when they are needed.

The rational for increasing the `referendumStageDuration` is that it will give Celo holders more time to respond to governance proposals. The decisions to raise the value to 7 days is informed by the work cadence of key Celo holders.

## Proposed Changes

1. Set `baselineQuorumFactor` to `0.5`

- Destination: Governance [setBaselineQuorumFactor](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/protocol/contracts/governance/Governance.sol#L395)
- Data: 500000000000000000000000 (1/2 \* 10^24 = 5e+23)
- Value: 0

2. Set `referendumStageDuration` to `604800`

- Destination: Governance [setReferendumStageDuration](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/protocol/contracts/governance/Governance.sol#L319)
- Data: 604800 (7 days in seconds)
- Value: 0

## Verification

1. Confirm proposal: run `celocli governance:view --proposalID <proposalID>`
2. Confirm Execution: run `celocli network:parameters --node https://forno.celo.org`

## Risks

Lowering the `baselineQuorumFactor` will decrease the amount of Celo needed to pass a governance proposal on the network. While this is the intended effect, it comes with an increased risk of malicious governance proposals being forced through without consensus from the community. This risk remains quite small and a sufficiently diversified quorum of Celo holders must still agree on a proposal for it to pass. Moreover, the approval stage provides protection against malicious proposals.
