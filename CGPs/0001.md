# CGP [0001]: Unfreeze Voter Rewards

- Date: 2020-05-12

- Date Executed: [if executed]

## Overview

This change unfreezes voter rewards by setting the target voting yield in the EpochRewards smart contract. Currently target voting yield is 0 so the voter rewards are 0.  Once this value is set >0, voters will begin receiving rewards.  This provides incentive for users to maintain stake in the network and vote for validators they feel provide benefit to the network.

The voter yield will be static as the adjustmentFactor will remain at 0.  In a later governance proposal, the adjustmentFactor will be set so that the contract can dynamically adjust the voting yield based on the target voting gold fraction and the Celo Gold supply.

Changes in parameters:

- targetVotingYieldParams.target: 0 --> 0.00016 ((x + 1) ^ 365 = 1.06)

This represents a value that will return 6% annual growth for voter rewards (as currently epoch rewards are distributed daily).  This was selected as a value that would be competitive with other proof-of-stake protocol yields and still be sustainable.


## Proposed Changes

1. Set Target Voting Yield
  - Destination: EpochRewards, [setTargetVotingYield](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/de09a44f5ea2c2116506a6b3d05dcaaef92d4fad/packages/protocol/contracts/governance/EpochRewards.sol#L271)
  - Data: 160000000000000000000 (0.00016 * 10^24)
  - Value: 0 (NA)

## Verification
1. Confirm proposal steps: run `celocli governance:view --proposalID x` // TODO add proposal ID once submitted proposal

### Post-Execution Verification
1. Check that voting accounts locked gold increases after one epoch.  You can do so by running CeloCli tooling for [election:show](https://docs.celo.org/command-line-interface/election#show) or [lockedGold:show](https://docs.celo.org/command-line-interface/lockedgold#show_).
2. Check EpochReward values for [TargetVotingYieldParameters](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/de09a44f5ea2c2116506a6b3d05dcaaef92d4fad/packages/protocol/contracts/governance/EpochRewards.sol#L52)

## Risks

Low risk -- if parameters were incorrect it could result in unexpectedly high or low voting yield, but risk is mitigated by capping at the max value 1.20 (20% annual growth).
