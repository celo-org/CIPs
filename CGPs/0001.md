# CGP [0001]: Unfreeze Voter Rewards

- Date: 2020-05-12
- Author: @aslawson
- Status: DRAFT
- Governance Proposal ID #: [if submitted]
- Date Executed: [if executed]

## Overview

This change unfreezes voter rewards by setting the target voting yield and adjustment factor in the EpochRewards smart contract. Currently these values are 0 so the voter rewards are 0.  Once the target is initialized and the adjustment factor added, the contract will adjust the voting yield based on the target voting gold fraction.

Changes in parameters:

- targetVotingYieldParams.target: 0 --> 0.00016 ((x + 1) ^ 365 = 1.06)
- targetVotingYieldParams.adjustmentFactor:  0 --> 1 / 3650  (or 0.00027397260274)
- targetVotingYieldParams.max:  unchanged (0.0005) ((x + 1) ^ 365 = 1.20)

// TODO add resourcing on how these values were determined

The means that voters will begin receiving rewards.  This provides incentive for users to maintain stake in the network and vote for validators they feel provide benefit to the network.

## Proposed Changes

1. Set Target Voting Yield
  - Destination: EpochRewards, [setTargetVotingYield](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/de09a44f5ea2c2116506a6b3d05dcaaef92d4fad/packages/protocol/contracts/governance/EpochRewards.sol#L271)
  - Data: 160000000000000000000 (0.00016 * 10^24)
  - Value: 0 (NA)
2. Set Target Voting Adjustment Factor (and keep max the same)
  - Destination: EpochRewards, [setTargetVotingYieldParameters](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/de09a44f5ea2c2116506a6b3d05dcaaef92d4fad/packages/protocol/contracts/governance/EpochRewards.sol#L297)
  - Data: max = 500000000000000000000 (0.0005 * 10^24), adjustmentFactor = 273972602740000000000 (0.00027397260274 * 10^24)
  - Value: 0 (NA)

## Verification
1. Confirm proposal steps: run `celocli governance:view --proposalID x` // TODO add proposal ID once submitted proposal

### Post-Execution Verification
1. Check that voting accounts locked gold increases after one epoch.  You can do so by running CeloCli tooling for [election:show](https://docs.celo.org/command-line-interface/election#show) or [lockedGold:show](https://docs.celo.org/command-line-interface/lockedgold#show_).
2. Check EpochReward values for [TargetVotingYieldParameters](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/de09a44f5ea2c2116506a6b3d05dcaaef92d4fad/packages/protocol/contracts/governance/EpochRewards.sol#L52)

## Risks

Low risk -- if parameters were incorrect it could result in unexpected adjustments to the voting yield, but risk is mitigated by capping at the max value.
