# CGP [0026]: cEUR freezing

- Date: 2021-03-01
- Author(s): @martinvol
- Status: DRAFT
- Governance Proposal ID #: [if submitted]
- Date Executed: [if executed]

## Overview

Following [CR3](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CGPs/0022.md), GCP #23 and GCP #26, cEUR will be in an status where it would be imposible to mint or burn due empty buckets that are not possible to update (assuming no oracle reports), but cEUR will be possible to move. This proposal is meant to prevent cEUR from moving before enabling the stability mechanism.

cEUR in circulation with no stability mechanism in place can lead to a depledge. Although the risk of cEUR moving before its full activation it's very low, this proposal will add an extra ledger of security. The only to address holding cEUR after CR3 is deployed will by the community fund (Governance Proxy) and a Celo Foundation wallet.


This proposal may be merge with CGP #26 if there's community consensus. # TODO add link once it's merged
