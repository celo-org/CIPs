# CGP [0025]: Set constitutional parameters for new contracts and methods added by CR3

- Date: 2021-03-1
- Author(s): @martinvol
- Status: DRAFT
- Governance Proposal ID #: [if submitted]
- Date Executed: [if executed]

## Overview

This proposal set the constitution value for methods in the new contracts deployed by [CR3](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CGPs/0022.md), namely `StableTokenEUR` and `ExchangeEUR`. It also sets constitucion values for new methods added on the reserve contract, `addExchangeSpender` and `removeExchangeSpender`. The values for `StableTokenEUR` and `ExchangeEUR` are meant to match the ones used for `StableToken` and `Exchange`.

Please note this proposal shall be submited after CR3 is proposed, because it needs an address for StableTokenEUR and ExchangeEUR, but it can be executed before.
