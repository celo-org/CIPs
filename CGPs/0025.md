This proposal set the constitution value for methods in the new contracts deployed by [CR3](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CGPs/0022.md), namely StableTokenEUR and ExchangeEUR. It also sets constitucion values for new methods added on the reserve contract, `addExchangeSpender` and `removeExchangeSpender`.
