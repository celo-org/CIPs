# CIPs/CGPs

Celoâ€™s Improvement Proposals (CIPs) describe standards for the Celo platform, including the core protocol specifications, SDK, and contract standards. A CIP is a design document that should provide background information, a rationale for the proposal, detailed solution including technical specifications, and, if any, a list of potential risks. The proposer is responsible for soliciting community feedback and for driving consensus.

Celo's Governance Proposals (CGPs) describe details of a governance proposal to the platform including parameter changes.  It should explain the reason for the change, enumerate the smart contract methods that will be called with parameters, and describe the impact and any risks.  The proposer is responsible for soliciting community feedback and driving consensus.

There may be instances that require both CIP and CGP, such as a change to a smart contract that requires a governance proposal to point the proxy to the new instance.

Participation in the Celo project is subject to the [Code of Conduct](https://celo.org/code-of-conduct).
