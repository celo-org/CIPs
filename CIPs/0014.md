# CIP [0014]: Add new exchange function to allow buying fixed amount of tokens for maximum price

## Overview

Current Exchange contract only allows trading in following form:
* sell X amount of tokens, for minimum price of Y.

It would be useful to have second exchange function that allows you to:
* buy X amount of tokens, for maximum price of Y.

This is a pretty standard feature for most trading platforms, since you should be able to
buy exactly X amount of tokens (no more no less), but with a set maximum `limit` price.

## Goals

- Allow Exchange contract to support full fledged complex trading applications better.

## Proposed Solution

Implementation itself would be pretty simple. Just need to add one new function in Exchange.sol
contract that is similar to already existing `exchange` function, but instead takes in `buyAmount`
and `maxSellAmount` arguments.

## Alternative Solutions

- Alternative is to not implement this and have everyone who does more complex trading on Celo,
implement bunch of workarounds.

## Risks

- Mistakes in Exchange.sol file can be very high risk. Thus this would need through review even
though code itself would be pretty small.
- This would require upgrading a contract, thus would have all the same risks associated with it.
