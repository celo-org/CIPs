## Simple Summary
Standard to find out the type of web3 provider to support dapps running in web browsers

## Abstract
- In the case of web DApps, you can only use [DSRV Celo Extension Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/celo-desktop-wallet/kkilomkmpmkbdnfelcpgckmpcaemjcdh) or MetaMask Extension wallet, but a standard is required to distinguish them.
- Through these standards, each provider can be identified and transactions can be sent to the Celo blockchain through appropriate operations.

## Motivation
To increase usability and accessibility by allowing celo DApps to be used not only in mobile environment but also in desktop environment.

## Specification
- Ready `ethereum.isMetaMask` property for MetaMask. Through this property, it can be seen that it is a provider injected in [MetaMask](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/ethereum-provider.html#properties).
- So, it is suggested that providers injected in Celo have a property with the syntax of `celo[providerName]`.
  * eg. Some injected provider has `celo.isDesktop` property. It's injected by DSRV Celo Extension wallet
  * eg. For DApp browser has `celo.isMobile` too
