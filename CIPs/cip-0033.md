## **Simple Summary**

Add cEUR as a second stabilized value digital asset to the Celo Network.

## **Abstract**

The addition of another stabilized value digital asset requires:

- the deployment of cEUR as a stabilized value digital asset,
- an extension of the stability mechanism to cover cEUR,
- additional oracles to be deployed.

We propose to add a second independent Mento unit ([Approach 1](#rationale)) to the network. The stability of each stabilized value digital asset is maintained independently. There will be no direct dependencies between the cUSD and the cEUR Mento unit. In particular, each Mento features its own Celo on-chain bucket and the pricing functions of the two automated market makers are not sensitive to transactions with the other Mento unit.

## **Motivation**

The addition of cEUR is the first step towards an ecosystem on Celo that hosts a family of stabilized value assets. Further assets can be added following the paragon of cEUR. Therefore, the addition of cEUR serves two purposes: extending the Celo network with an important stabilized value digital asset as well preparing the ground for future extensions with other stabilized value assets.

## **Specification**

### Deployment of cEUR

**For StableToken:**

- Retain stableToken in the registry (for compatibility).
- Create a new entry called cUSD pointing to the same as stableToken entry.
- Create a new entry called cEUR pointing to a new cEUR proxy.
- Add a new Gas currency (cEUR) to the FeeCurrencyWhitelist.

**Proxy implementations:**
A priori, no changes should be written to the proxy contracts.

**Implementation**
- Deploy a cEUR proxy (e.g. cEURProxy), with the same implementation as cUSDProxy.

### Stability Mechanism

For cEUR one independent Mento will be deployed. All Mento exchanges (cUSD and cEUR) will be backed by the same reserve.

**For Exchange:**

- Retain exchange in the registry (for compatibility).
- Create a new entry called (e.g. exchangecUSD) pointing to the same as exchange entry.
- Create a new entry called (e.g exchangecEUR) pointing to a new exchange proxy for cEUR.

**For Reserve:**

- The reserve needs to be able to send CELO to multiple exchanges spenders (see [#6165](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/issues/6165)).
- New Proxy spender address should be added to the reserve.

**Proxy implementations:**<br>
A priori, no changes should be written to the proxy contracts.

- Deploy a new exchange proxy (e.g. exchangecEUR) pointing to the same implementation as existing exchange.

### Oracle Deployment

Add new/existing oracle address to support cEUR. If liquidity of cEUR is considered to be too low to provide a reliable oracle service for Celo/cEUR, an oracle is implemented that uses either fiat exchange rates (EUR/USD) or crypto exchange rates (e.g. CELO/BTC, BTC/EUR) to imply and report Celo/cEUR rates.

### Miscellaneous

- Similar to the deployment of cUSD and in order to bootstrap initial liquidity of cEUR, there will be a pre-minted amount of cEUR provided. The pre-minting procedure and execution will be governed by a dedicated governance proposal.
- Modify the celocli to include changes.
- Modify ContractKit to include changes.

## **Rationale**

With stability of each stabilized value asset on Celo being our priority our decision was guided by the following set of key questions:

- What is the level of control (e.g. max drain per update cycle) and should parameters be added to extend the level of control (e.g. maximum amount of trading amount per ccy)?
- How difficult or time consuming is the implementation?
- Can the Multi Mento approach reach an equilibrium state?
- How fast is the speed of convergence of Mento?
- How does it scale with additional stabilized value assets (from an engineering and stability perspective)?
- Should multi-asset Mento support cheap direct stable-value asset to stable-value asset transactions?
- How does Mento deal with low liquidity?
- How do Mento oracles work for assets with low liquidity? Can Mento use fiat exchange rates as a proxy? What are reliable fiat exchange rate sources? Are they available on weekends and holidays?

We have considered two approaches. Both approaches can be considered as natural extensions of the current single pair Mento. The first approach follows the conceptual idea of 'adding' another Mento unit to construct a two currency Mento. The second approach follows the idea of 'multiplying' a second currency as another factor.

**Approach 1:** Independent Mentos (The Freshmaker)

For each currency (e.g. cUSD and cEUR) one independent Mento will be deployed. All Mento exchanges will be backed by the same reserve.

**Approach 2:** Multi Mento

Mento will be redesigned/extended to be a multi asset AMM. The constant product function will be extended by one factor:

### Comparison of Multi Mento Approaches

- Overall convergence speed of both approaches is roughly of the same scale (sum of absolute values)
- Independent Mentos has slightly faster convergence in the tail (apart from double depeg in opposite direction)
- Multi Mento has faster short term convergence in terms of maximum deviation, but
  - requires one rate to depeg initially (cross-currency on-chain price sensitivity)
  - falls behind slightly in cases of a single depeg or a double depeg in the same direction
- Multi Mento has faster convergence speed in the case of double depeg in opposite directions
- Independent Mentos naturally allows independent control of the bucket setups; Multi Mento requires at least the implementation of limitation of the trade amount.
- Total Celo bucket size requirement (and hence Celo exposure) in case of Multi Mento might be smaller.
- Multi Mento has not been implemented yet; the Mento units in the independent Mento setup are 'field approved'.
- Multi Mento allows direct, 'cheap' stabilized value asset transactions, i.e. in one transaction instead of in two.

**Comparison Table**
| Feature | Winner | Independent Mentos | Multi Mento |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overall Simultaneous convergence speed | | - similar | - similar<br> - double depeg opposite direction: much faster speed of convergence |
| Tail convergence | Indie | - single depeg <br> - double depeg same direction | - double depeg opposite direction |
| Short term speed of convergence (max deviation) | Multi | | faster |
| Independent control of trading volumes | Indie | yes, due to modular setup | requires additional implementation |
| Total Celo Bucket Size Requirement | Multi | potentially smaller |
| 'Field Approval' | Indie | yes, as separate Mento unit | no |
| Direct Stabilized Value Asset Transactions | Multi | requires additional cEUR/cUSD Mento module | yes |
| Cross currency on-chain price sensitivity | Indie | no | yes |

### Mathematical Model & Comparison of Speed of Convergence
