This is the Meta CIP for the technical specifications of the Celo Churrito Hardfork.

## Simple Summary

Enable the activation of the Celo Churrito Hardfork specification which includes important security patch to ensure correct specification of EVM behavior. 

## Abstract

Add support for protocol-impacting changes introduced in Geth in a hardfork called `Churrito`.

This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the Celo networks:
- `2840059` on Baklava Testnet (Tuesday November 24th, 2020)
- `2562112` on Alfajores Testnet (Tuesday December 1st, 2020)
- `4218172` on Celo Mainnet (Tuesday December 8th, 2020)

For more information on the opcodes and their respective EIPs and CIP implementations, please see the _Specification_
section of this document.

## Motivation

To improve the security of the EVM and ensure it is correctly specified.

## Specification

The Churrito Hardfork specification meta document will correctly implement the following EIP:
* [EIP 211: New opcodes: RETURNDATASIZE and RETURNDATACOPY](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-211)

## Rationale

__Security__: Enables Celo network to add security changes to the EVM from latest Geth upstream to minimize issues. 

## Implementation

Adoption of the content of this CIP requires a hardfork as it introduces changes that aren't backward compatible. The following clients with Celo support will implement the Celo Churrito hardfork specification:
- celo-blockchain
