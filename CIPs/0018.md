# CIP [0018]: Change group epoch score calculation for voter rewards

## Overview

Currently group epoch score is calculated as an average score of its members epoch score
for voter rewards. 

Because of this, larger groups with more validators in them have a distinct advantage for 
voters since their average score per epoch is likely going to be higher since they are able to 
average out individual bad validator scores with better performing validators.

This seems counter productive since for network health it would be better to incentivize voters
to vote for smaller groups for more decentralization.

Fix for this can be very simple, we change group epoch score to be:
* Minimum(member validator epoch scores), instead of Avg(member validator epoch scores).

Calculating score per epoch using minimum incetinvizes voting for smaller groups since they
are more likely to maintain better epoch scores, and it also puts more pressure on larger groups
to make sure all their validators maintain high uptime.

This is a pretty simple change, and it only needs to be changed in one place here:
calculateGroupEpochScore function in Validators.sol

## Goals

- Shift voter incentive to vote for smaller groups instead of larger groups.
- Provide more incentive for larger groups to maintain high uptime for all of their validators.

## Proposed Solution


Change calculateGroupEpochScore function in Validators.sol to calculate group score using 
a minimum instead of average.

## Alternative Solutions

## Risks

Standard contract upgrade risk. Change should be very simple, thus there isnt a huge risk with
the change itself.
