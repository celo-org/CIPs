### Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html).

## Simple Summary

Validators are paid with rewards to maintain the network. Their pay rate is lowered if they failed to sign blocks for a fixed duration (the "lookback window"). This proposal suggests adjusting the lookback window on-chain via community governance.

## Abstract

Each epoch, the Celo protocol elects validators trusted to sign mined blocks and, in return, they recieve Celo gold at the end of the epoch. What happens if an elected validator fails to sign the blocks it's been assigned? During an epoch, the Celo protocol will keep track of each validator's score, as a percentage, and the rewards paid will be proportional to their score.

The purpose of this score is to make sure the validator is doing the work it has been assigned. A validator's score can be penalized for various reasons. This proposal is focused on the uptime metric.

A validator's uptime is measured by keeping track of the blocks it signs. If a determined amount of consecutive blocks haven't been signed, the validator is considered to be down. This fixed amount of blocks is called the lookback window and its value is currently 12 blocks. Given that a block is mined every 5 seconds, the lookback window is 1 minute. The value currently lies in the chain config, meaning that changing the value is a hard fork, and requires rebooting the node with an updated chain config.

## Motivation

In practice, the lookback window has penalized validators for performing routine node maintenance. To solve this, the window this CIP updates the lookback window to be dynamically adjustable by the community - in other words, governable. This will let anyone with stake vote on the value of this parameter.

## Goals

- The lookback window parameter must be adjustable.
- The community must decide on the value.

## Specification

The proposed solution is to migrate the parameter to the EVM state (layer 2).

We define the following constants:

- `MIN_SAFE_LOOKBACK_WINDOW = 12`
- `MAX_SAFE_LOOKBACK_WINDOW = 720`

Before `HARDFORK_BLOCK` The `BlockchainParameters.sol` contract is updated to add a new public state variable `uptimeLookbackWindow` with a governable setter.

```solidity
  uint256 public uptimeLookbackWindow;
  event UptimeLookbackWindowSet(uint256 window);

  function setUptimeLookbackWindow(uint256 window) public onlyOwner returns (uint256) {
    require(
      window >= MIN_SAFE_LOOKBACK_WINDOW &&window <= MAX_SAFE_LOOKBACK_WINDOW
    );
    ...
  }
```

Starting at `HARDFORK_BLOCK`, block creation and validation MUST read the lookback window from chain state by calling the `BlockchainParameters` contract, rather than reading chain paramaters. Reward calculations are unaffected.

If the return value is outside the safe window, the node MUST clamp the return value to that range such that `MIN_SAFE_LOOKBACK_WINDOW <= window <= MAX_SAFE_LOOKBACK_WINDOW`. If the result is greater than the `epoch size - 2`, the node MUST discard the result and use `epochSize - 2` instead. If the epoch size is 3 or less, the node MUST error, as it is in an invalid state.

If the `BlockchainParameters.sol` contract errors or returns 0, the node MUST use the default value `MIN_SAFE_LOOKBACK_WINDOW`.

```python
def clamp_lookback_window(window: int) -> int:
    # clamp to range
    window = max(window, MIN_SAFE_LOOKBACK_WINDOW)
    window = min(window, MAX_SAFE_LOOKBACK_WINDOW)
    return window

def get_lookback_window(chain: ChainState) -> int:
    window: int

    # get the lookback window from the chain state.
    # default to 12 in case of error
    try:
        window = chain.evm.get_blockchain_param("lookbackWindow")
        window = clamp_lookback_window(window)
    except EVMExecutionError:
        window = MIN_SAFE_LOOKBACK_WINDOW

    # invalid chain param
    assert chain.params.epoch_size > 3

    # ensure it is sensible given the chain params
    if window > chain.params.epoch_size - 2:
        window = chain.params.epoch_size - 2

    return window
```

This way, the parameter will be handled by the `BlockchainParameters` contract and it will be fetched with a static view call from the node (layer 1). This requires a hard fork, replacing any reference to the parameter with a contract call.

## Backwards Compatibility

The proposed solution will be used only after the Donut Hard Fork is active. If Donut is not active, processing MUST use the original value of 12.

## Security Considerations

The lookback window is queried for each block processed, so this would add a contract call for each block. It might be quite expensive but it is a view call.

The lookback window must have built in boundaries to limit the window from being excessively long (meaning validators could be down for a long time without hurting their score) or too small. The specification limits window size to between 12 blocks (1 minute) and 720 blocks (1 hour). These are not suggestions for the window. They are sanity checks on the output of the governance process to preserve invariants necessary for chain operation.

Consider a lazy, but not malicious validator. To maintain uptime, they need only sign one block per lookback window. If the lookback window is one day, the lazy validator may choose to run their node for only 5 minutes per day, while earning full rewards. If this becomes the dominant strategy among validators, it may have severe impacts on network liveness. It is important to keep the lookback window relatively short compared to the epoch, to prevent this behavior.
