## Simple Summary

Encourage liveness and global coverage of the Attestation Service (AS) through the incentivization of successful customer onboarding. This CIP will split validator rewards and use a portion to incentivize Attestation Service availability.

## Abstract

The Attestation Service performs a critical role in user onboarding when linking a phone number to a Celo address. When AS nodes are down or have poor coverage they lead to a degraded user experience. This proposal focuses on explicit incentives to run a highly available AS.

## Motivation

Despite Validator uptime on Celo being phenomenal, the maintenance of the AS nodes are [sometimes neglected](https://metabase.celo-networks-dev.org/public/dashboard/b0a27650-1d62-4645-81d7-26ff7546ff0d?date_filter=past2weeks~). Today the implicit motivation to run an AS is to contribute to the health of the network which can help procure more votes from those that are interested in the success of Celo. This proposal leverages the completion rate of an Attestation Service to determine the payout percentage that a validator will receive.

## Specification

The `Validators.distributeEpochPaymentsFromSigner()` method will be updated to take into account the status and performance of the signer's Attestation Service. The `maxPayment` will be divided into two payments, with 80% going to the operation of the Validator and 20% going to the operation of the Attestation Service. The 80% will act as the new base reward for the validator (`actual reward = base * score * slashingMultiplier`).

The Attestation Reward will be affected directly by the completion rate of the Attestation Service during each epoch. Since a 100% completion rate is unrealistic, a governable target completion rate will be used to determine the rewards. To ensure that an Attestation Service isn't incorrectly penalized by a bug outside of their responsibilities (ex. Valora), a minimum global attestation completion rate for this epoch will be first considered. The minimum global attestation completion rate is a dynamic value calculated by applying the `MinGlobalAttestationCompletionRate` to the moving average from the last `AttestationBaselineEpochCount` epochs (ex. global completion rate shouldn't dip below .3 * avg completion rate of the last 30 epochs). If the minimum global attestation completion rate is not met, all elected Attestation Services will be rewarded with 75% the maximum amount, regardless of their score. A registered Attestation Service can be forcibly deregistered if they don't meet the minimum number of attestations over a governable sliding window. The Attestation Reward will be forfeited if the validator does not have a registered Attestation Service.

- `TargetCompletionRate` - The target completion rate for Attestation Services, taking into account standard user drop-off and other factors outside of the AS control.
- `AttestationServiceRewardPercentage` - The percentage of max rewards that are allocated to running an Attestation Service. Initially `.20`.
- `AttestationBaselineEpochCount` - The number of epochs to consider when calculating the global baseline.
- `MinGlobalAttestationCompletionRate` - The rate applied to the baseline to determine the minimum rate across all validators for rewards to be reduced for registered Attestation Services.
- `GlobalAttestationFailureFallbackReward` - The rate that Attestation Service operators will be rewarded when the global completion rate drops below `MinGlobalAttestationCompletionRate`.

- `AttestationMinPeriod` - The period which the issuer must complete at least one successful attestation or potentially face deregistration.
- `AttestationMinRequested` - The minimum number of attestations requested from the issuer to be eligible for removal.
- `MinNumberOfAttestationIssuers` - If deregistering an Attestation Service would drop the count below this number, then prevent removal.

The `Attestations` contract will be upgraded to register the request and completion events. It will be read by the new `Validators` contract. The `Attestations` contract will contain the following state to track the request and completion counts per epoch:

```js
// Tracks per issuer completion rate
// These values are reset per issuer from Validators.distributeEpochPaymentsFromSigner()
mapping(address => uint256) public attestationRequestCount;
mapping(address => uint256) public attestationCompletionCount;

// Track global completion rate per epoch
// currEpochIndex = getEpochNumberOfBlock(block.number) % AttestationBaselineEpochCount
// These values get overwritten as the baseline sliding window progresses
uint64[] public epochRequestCount;
uint64[] public epochIndexToCompletionCount;

// Tracks the last AttestationMinRequested times an attestation was requested from an issuer (AS node)
mapping(address => uint256[]) public lastAttestationRequested;
// Tracks the last time an attestation was completed by an issuer
mapping(address => uint256) public lastAttestationCompleted;
```

Each `selectIssuers()` call will update the global attestation request count and the per issuer request count. The global counts are stored in a fixed array that holds the last `AttestationBaselineEpochCount` counts. If `getEpochNumberOfBlock(block.number) % AttestationBaselineEpochCount` is different from the `currEpochIndex`, `currEpochIndex` is updated and the global counters at the index are reset. These global arrays can be used to calculate the average completion rate to generate the baseline.

In the final block of the epoch, `distributeEpochPaymentsFromSigner` will be called for each signer. After issuing the rewards, the `Validators` contract will reset the value of the issuer's request count and completion count to zero. This prevents the need for extra state in the contract. Note that this technique does not work for the global completion state since it's not currently possible to know when `distributeEpochPaymentsFromSigner` is being called for the last signer (we can't reset it before then).

To calculate the Attestation Service payout, the individual's completion score will be compared against the `TargetCompletionRate`. Any completion rate that exceeds the target will receive a full payout. Any completion rate below the target will receive a linear amount of the rewards as a percentage of the target (`MeasuredCompletionRate` / `TargetCompletionRate`).

### Baseline and Fallback Rewards

As stated above, if the global completion rate dips significantly below the baseline (ex. avg from last 30 days), then a validator's rewards get set to the fallback reward rate (ex. 75%) if they normally would have dropped below this reward rate. If their reward rate is 75% or higher, their reward is unimpacted. This ensures that validators are not severly punished for a systemic outage outside of their control, but also provides some incentive to get back online (to be able to reach 100% payout again). During such a period, attestation services may not be removed due to performance. Note that because the baseline is calculated as a sliding window, the longer that the outage lasts, the lower the baseline drops. It's therefore important to set the baseline window to a long enough duration (ex. 30 days) to not be impacted by temporary outages.

### Opting out

It may be that a validator does not wish for the extra work of managing an Attestation Service. To opt out of running one, they may call `Accounts.removeAttestationSigner()` which will set their attestation signer to `address(0)`. If an insufficient number of validators wish to run an Attestation Service for the `AttestationServiceRewardPercentage`, a new governance proposal will be added to adjust this payout percentage or increase the `targetValidatorEpochPayment` until an equilibrium state is reached.

### Minimum Attestation Performance

To ensure a quality user experience, a faulty Attestation Service may be forcibly removed from the set of issuers. To qualify as faulty, an Attestation Service must be unable to complete at least one attestation in `AttestationMinPeriod`. This ability to deregister an Attestation Service is only available if there have been `AttestationMinRequested` to this Attestation Service during this period and that removing this Attestation Service wouldn't drop the number of registered services below `MinNumberOfAttestationIssuers`. For example, an Attestation Service may be deregistered if it fails to complete at least 1 attestation if prompted with 8 attestation requests over 2 days. It's possible for an attestation service to re-register at any point in time. If it's observed that validators re-register frequently without fixing the service, a future proposal may introduce a penalty upon removal. The `MinNumberOfAttestationIssuers` acts as a safety check to prevent large numbers of Attestations becoming deregistered due to a systemic outage (ex. sustained Valora or SMS provider failures). Additionally, if the global completion rate drops below the fallback threshold, then Attestation Services are not eligible for deregistration.

### Is one epoch a large enough sample?

There are around 800 Attestations requested per day (ignoring spikes in signups). Therefore each of the Attestation Services would expect to receive 8 requests if all 100 validators operated an Attestation Service. With this small sample, the measured result might not be perfectly representative of an Attestation Service's performance. This is partially mitigated by setting a `TargetCompletionRate` that is less than 100%, still giving any Attestation Service 100% of the reward if they're at or above this target. Additionally, this reward is per epoch and will average out over enough epochs to represent the actual performance of an Attestation Service.

### Defining parameters

- `TargetCompletionRate` - From a week's worth of recent data (Feb 5th, 2021) a vast majority of Attestation Services perform above 70% completion rate. Only 7/97 services performed below 70%, all which were above 60%. The proposed starting point for the target is `.60` and can be raised if other areas of the protocol reliability are improved that would naturally raise the completion rate of all services.
- `AttestationServiceRewardPercentage` - Setting `.20` would allocate 15k cUSD/year to run an Attestation Service and 60 cUSD/year to run a Validator Service. This value will initially start at `0` and we will use a separate CGP to update the reward breakdown.
- `GlobalAttestationFailureFallbackReward` - The starting point will be `.75`. This is low enough to encourage Attestation Services to come back online in the case of a total outage, but high enough to not significantly impact rewards.
- `AttestationBaselineEpochCount` - This will start out at a `30` epochs. If this value is too short, a multi-day outage will actually cause the baseline to drop significantly, leading to a inneffective fallback system shortly after this outage.
- `MinGlobalAttestationCompletionRate` - This value will start at `.66` which implies that the fallback reward will be enabled if global completion rate drops below 2/3 of the 30 day moving average.

- `AttestationMinPeriod` - An Attestation Service should complete at least 1 attestation over 2 days. This number can be more aggressive since there's no penalty and the validator can always re-register to get back in.
- `AttestationMinRequested` - 8.
- `MinNumberOfAttestationIssuers` - 60. Any lower than this and the random selection of issuers is too easy to game. [See this discussion for more details](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/issues/7057#issuecomment-779639780)

### Steps

1. Author, test, audit, and publish the new `Attestations` and `Validators` contracts.
2. Update the two contracts via governance proposal.
3. Build monitoring and a dashboard for the payout per Attestation Service.

## Other solutions considered

### Relative performance

Instead of rewarding validators a percentage of a fixed amount, it was considered to reward all Attestation Services from the same pool based on relative performance. This would allow some high performing Attestation Services to be rewarded more than the current max amount. It would also protect against uncontrollable outages such as bugs in Valora since it would affect everyone equally. This was decided against for two reasons:

1. It introduces direct competition in a model that is gamable. Rather than being encouraged to help each other, this incentivizes an attestation service operator to boost their own performance at the cost of others.
2. Calculating the relative completion rate introduces more complexity into the smart contract.

We can still account for uncontrollable outages by taking into account the global attestation completion rate and reward everyone a slightly impacted amount `GlobalAttestationFailureFallbackReward`, if the global rate is below `MinGlobalAttestationCompletionRate`. This amount is lower than the max amount that an Attestation Service operator could earn to prevent the incentive to lower the global rate below this threshold.

### Attestation Slasher

A new slashing contract which would slash a validator's locked gold if the Attestation Service did not meet a minimum number of attestations. The Attestations contract would slash faulty services similar to how the proposed solution above will deregister them if they don't complete a minimum number of attestations.

### Guilty until proven innocent

The same solution above, but with a challenge/response pattern. Rather than providing a proof of outage, a slasher would simply claim that a validator's AS wasn't available during a certain block interval and provide stake to back this claim. If the validator to-be-slashed can provide a proof that they either did complete an attestation or that they were unelected during the interval, then they wouldn't get slashed and would be rewarded with the would-be-slashers stake. The benefit of this approach is that the proof size and validation is much smaller and would lower the gas consumption. The downside is that this requires the AS to monitor for malicious slashes and provide a proof to refute it, which introduces more complexity (the monitor must be funded and highly available).

### Uptime Score

One proposal was to use the uptime score as the main incentive mechanism. In this model, a long outage in the Attestation Service would also have weight on a Validator's uptime score. The downside of this approach is that it would require a hardfork to implement. Given that this is just the first stop on a long iteration process, there's a preference for something adjustable with a faster turnaround process.

### Foundation votes

The Foundation holds a large amount of Celo and uses it [today to incentivize behavior to support a healthy network](https://docs.celo.org/validator-guide/celo-foundation-voting-policy). The Foundation voting does already check that validators are running a highly available attestation service; however there should be an additional incentive for the following reasons:

1. Some validators are not eligible for foundation votes. The solution should apply to all validators to improve the overall AS availability.
2. Voting frequency is every 3 months, which is not immediate enough to motivate an operator to regularly monitor and maintain their AS availability.

### Governance Slashing

There exists a generic slashing contract which allows anyone to slash for any reason via a governance proposal. This process is good for one-off slashing events, but requires a large amount of coordination for each event. It's better to have something more automatic where the rules are stated explicitly ahead of time.
