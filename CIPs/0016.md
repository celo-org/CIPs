## Overview

Create a standard URI scheme for encoding interacting with the Celo protocol for various consumers including SDKs, mobile/web wallets, and end users.
Facilitate development of QR systems by standardizing usage and unifying scheme for interoperability.

## Goals

- establish URI standard compatible with mobile app intents that optimizes for **memory** and **performance**
- enable simple construction of URIs by humans without deep Celo protocol understanding
- enable simple construction of QRs by code from arbitrary Celo transactions

## Proposed Solution

### Syntax

Celo protocol URLs contain "celo" in their schema (protocol) part and are constructed as follows:

    request                 = "celo://" target [ "/" endpoint ] [ "?" parameters ]

    target                  = E164_PHONE_NUMBER / registry_id / celo_address
    registry_id             = "StableToken" / "GoldToken" / "LockedGold" / ...
    celo_address            = ( "0x" 40*HEXDIG )

    endpoint                = function_name "(" [ function_args ] ")
    function_name           = "cUSD" / "CELO" / STRING
    function_args           = function_arg *( "," function_arg )
    function_arg            = value [ ":" TYPE ]

    parameters              = parameter *( "&" parameter )
    parameter               = key "=" value
    key                     = "value" / "gas" / "gasPrice" / "feeCurrency" / "gatewayFee" / "gatewayFeeRecipient" / "localValue" / "localCurrencyCode" / "from" / "nonce"
    value                   = NUMBER / STRING / celo_address

### Semantics

`TYPE` is a standard ABI type name, as defined in [Ethereum Contract ABI specification](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html). `STRING` is a URL-encoded unicode string of arbitrary length, where delimiters and the percentage symbol (`%`) are mandatorily hex-encoded with a `%` prefix.

`E164_PHONE_NUMBER` is a standard E164 universal phone number, as defined by the International Telecommunication Union [E164 Number Specification](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164).

`registry_id` is provided to simplify and shorten Celo protocol-aware contract interactions (to be eventually translated by the application to a registry-specified 40 byte address). The canonical list of registry identifiers can be obtained from the contract deployed at `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000ce10`.

`cUSD` and `CELO` are provided as a concise encoding of native ERC20 transfers that would otherwise be represented via a contract `registry_id`, `function_name`, and recipient `celo_address`. These optionally take 1 `function_arg` which is an amount in the token denomination.

`function_args` have an optional `TYPE` because, in some cases, the application may have knowledge of the ABIs deeming the solidity types unnecessary. These can most likely be omitted when used with a Celo registry contract via a `registry_id` target.

`localValue` is intended for use with `localCurrencyCode` and specifies a value in a locale-specific denomination (to be eventually translated by the application to a Celo-specific denomination). Resolving `value` with `localValue` is discretionary.

All `key` values should be acommodated in abbreviations as the first character from each camelcase section. As an example, `value`, `localCurrency` and `gatewayFeeRecipient` could be provided as `v`, `lc` and `gfr`.

### Rationale

Various QR schemes are used across implementations such as Valora, ContractKit, and likely others.

Expanding the `target` spec to be inclusive of phone numbers and contract registry identifiers makes statically generated QR codes less likely to expire than if an address (which can be changed or compromised) is used.

For low-end mobile devices, QR codes are primarily bottlenecked by pixel density and image quality (Reed-Solomon error-correction). This proposal optimizes for these parameters and enables short URIs which can be deep-linked to application functionality.

- Valora example: `celo://+442071838750/cUSD(10)` (29 chars)

## Alternative Solutions

A more ethereum-like VM generalized approach would reduce spec complexity but fails to meet aforementioned goals.

## Risks

- Ease of use for phone number targets and/or unique mapping of phone number to address.
