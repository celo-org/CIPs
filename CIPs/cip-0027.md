This is the Meta CIP for the technical specifications of the Celo Donut Hardfork.

## Simple Summary

Enable the activation of the Celo Donut Hardfork specification which includes Ethereum Berlin EIPs and Celo CIPs.

## Abstract

Add support for protocol-impacting changes introduced in the Ethereum Berlin specification for Yolov3 and Celo improvement proposals in a hardfork
named by the community as _Donut_.

This hardfork includes pre-Berlin EIPs like simple EVM subroutines and gas cost increases for state access opcodes, as well as BLS precompiles and extensible hash-function precompiles.

This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the Celo networks:
- `TBD` on Baklava Testnet ()
- `TBD` on Alfajores Testnet ()
- `TBD` on Celo Mainnet ()
For more information on the opcodes and their respective EIPs and CIP implementations, please see the _Specification_
section of this document.

## Motivation

The enhance the EVM's capabilities and while pushing forward the Celo blockchain functionality in order to enable economic conditions for prosperity as well as adopting Ethereum's Berlin specifications.

## Specification

The Donut Hardfork specification meta document includes the following proposals:
* [CIP 25: Ed25519 Precompile](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0025.md)
* [CIP 31: BLS Curve Operations on 12-381](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0031.md)
* [CIP 30: BLS Curve Operations on 12-377](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0030.md)
* [CIP 20: Extensible Hash Function Precompile](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0020.md)
* [CIP 21: Governable Lookback Window](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0021.md)
* [CIP 22: Epoch Snark Data](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0022.md)
* [CIP 26: Precompile for BLS](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0026.md)
* [CIP 28: Split etherbase](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0028.md)
* [CIP 35: Support for Ethereum-compatible transactions](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0035.md)

## Rationale

__Functionality__: We add a number of new features and precompiles to enable new cryptographic protocols and support Plumo.

__Validator Quality of Life__: CIPs 21 and Split Etherbase proposal address common validator needs with respect to reward allocation.

## Implementation

Adoption of the content of this CIP requires a hardfork as it introduces changes that aren't backward compatible. The following clients with Celo support will implement the Celo Donut hardfork specification:
